Vilnius (/ˈvɪlniəs/ ⓘ VIL-nee-əs, Lithuanian: [ˈvʲɪlʲnʲʊs] ⓘ) is the capital of and largest city in Lithuania and the most-populous city in the Baltic states. The city's estimated January 2025 population was 607,667,[7] and the Vilnius urban area (which extends beyond the city limits) has an estimated population of 747,864.[8]
Vilnius is notable for the architecture of its Old Town, considered one of Europe's largest and best-preserved old towns. The city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.[13][14][15][16] The architectural style known as Vilnian Baroque is named after the city, which is farthest to the east among Baroque cities, next to Vitebsk, Mogilev and Minsk.[17]
The city was noted for its multicultural population during the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with contemporary sources comparing it to Babylon. Before World War II and the Holocaust, Vilnius was one of Europe's most important Jewish centers. Its Jewish influence had led to its being called "the Jerusalem of Lithuania", and Napoleon called it "the Jerusalem of the North"[18] when he passed through in 1812.
Vilnius was a 2009 European Capital of Culture with Linz in Austria.[19] In 2021, the city was named one of fDi's 25 Global Cities of the Future.[20] Vilnius is considered a global financial centre, ranked 76th globally and 29th in Europe on the Global Financial Centres Index.[21] The city is an important center for the global fintech industry.[22] It hosted the 2023 NATO Summit. In 2025 Vilnius was the European Green Capital.[23][24] Vilnius is a member of Eurocities[25] and the Union of Capitals of the European Union (UCEU).[26]
Etymology and other names
The name of Vilnius first appeared in Latin-edited letters by Gediminas from the year 1323, in the form Vilna (in civitate nostra regia, dicta Vilna).[27] In another letter from 1325, the form Wilno also appears (Datum Wilno).[27] Both forms ultimately originate from the old Lithuanian name of the tributary river Vilnia (meaning ripple),[28] which flows into the Neris River in the center of old Vilnius, near the Castle Hill. The name of the river was transferred to the city.[27] The form Wilno is still used in the Polish language today. The Lithuanian form Vilnius, which is used today, was recorded at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries in Mikalojus Daukša's “Postil,” but it only became widespread during the Lithuanian national revival at the end of the 19th century.[27]
The form Vilna made its way into Western European languages and for a long time served as the standard designation for the city of Vilnius, especially in historical and diplomatic texts. The most notable non-Lithuanian names for the city include Latin: Vilna, Polish: Wilno, Belarusian: Вiльня (Vilnia), German: Wilna, Latvian: Viļņa, Ukrainian: Вільно (Vilno), Yiddish: ווילנע (Vilne), Hebrew: וילנה (Vilna). A Russian name dating to the Russian Empire was Вильна (Vilna),[29][30] although Вильнюс (Vilnyus) is now used.
1835 painting by Aleksander Lesser of Gediminas' dream about an Iron Wolf
According to a legend recorded around the 1530s, Grand Duke Gediminas (c. 1275–1341) was hunting in the sacred forest near Šventaragis' Valley, where the Vilnia River flows into the Neris. The successful hunt for a wisent lasted longer than expected, and Gediminas decided to spend the night in the valley. That night, he dreamed of a huge Iron Wolf standing on top of a hill, howling loudly. Upon awakening, the Duke asked the krivis Lizdeika to interpret the dream. The chief priest explained:
    What is destined for the ruler and the State of Lithuania, is thus: the Iron Wolf represents a castle and a city which will be established by you on this site. This city will be the capital of the Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of their rulers, and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world.
Gediminas, obeying the gods, built two castles: the Lower Castle in the valley, and the Crooked Castle on Bald Hill. He moved his court there, declared it his permanent seat and capital, and developed the surrounding area into a city he named Vilnius.[31][better source needed][32]

Vilnius' history dates to the Stone Age.[33] The city at least from 1323 until 1795 was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Later Vilnius was ruled by imperial and Soviet Russia, Napoleonic France, imperial and Nazi Germany, interwar Poland, and again became a capital of Lithuania in the 20th century.[33]
A Baltic settlement since its foundation, Vilnius became significant in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[33] The city was first mentioned in letters by Grand Duke Gediminas, who invited Jews and Germans to settle and built a wooden castle on a hill.[33] Vilnius became a city when it was given city rights in 1387, after the Christianization of Lithuania, and was settled by craftsmen and merchants of a variety of nationalities.[33] It was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (until 1795) within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[33] Vilnius flourished under the Commonwealth, especially after the 1579 establishment of Vilnius University by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Stephen Báthory.[33] The city became a cultural and scientific center, attracting migrants from east and west.[33] It had diverse communities, with Jewish, Orthodox, and German populations.[33] The city experienced a number of invasions and occupations, including by the Teutonic Knights, Russia and, later, Germany.[33]
Under imperial Russian rule, Vilnius became the capital of Vilna Governorate and had a number of cultural revivals during the 19th and early 20th centuries by Jews, Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians.[33] After World War I, the city experienced conflict between Poland and Lithuania which led to its occupation by Poland before its annexation by the Soviet Union during World War II.[33] After that war, Vilnius became the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.[33]

On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR announced its secession from the Soviet Union and intention to restore an independent Lithuania.[34] On 9 January 1991, the Soviet Union sent in troops; this culminated in the 13 January attack on the State Radio and Television Building and Vilnius TV Tower which killed 14 civilians.[35] The Soviet Union recognised Lithuanian independence in September 1991.[36] According to the Constitution of Lithuania, "the capital of the State of Lithuania shall be the city of Vilnius, the long-standing historical capital of Lithuania".

Vilnius has become a modern European city. Its territory has been expanded with three acts since 1990, incorporating urban areas, villages, hamlets, and the city of Grigiškės.[37][38] Most historic buildings have been renovated and a business and commercial area became the New City Centre, the main administrative and business district on the north side of the river Neris. The area includes modern residential and retail space, with the municipal building and the 148.3 m (487 ft) Europa Tower its most prominent buildings. The construction of Swedbank's headquarters indicates the importance of Scandinavian banks in Vilnius. The Vilnius Business Harbour complex was built and expanded. Over 75,000 flats were built from 1995 to 2018, making the city a Baltic construction leader.
Vilnius was selected as a 2009 European Capital of Culture with Linz, the capital of Upper Austria.[39][40] The 2008 financial crisis led to a drop in tourism, which prevented many projects from completion; allegations of corruption and incompetence were made;[41][42] tax increases for cultural activity led to protests,[43] and economic conditions sparked riots.[44] On 28–29 November 2013, Vilnius hosted the Eastern Partnership summit at the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Many European presidents, prime ministers, and high-ranking officials participated.[45] In 2015, Remigijus Šimašius became the city's first directly elected mayor.[46] The 2023 NATO summit was held in Vilnius.[47]
